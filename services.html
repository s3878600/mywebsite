                                <u>Overview:</u></br>
                        The project that I have in mind right now is an autonomous (self-driving) robot. Its job will be delivering things, especially heavy things, from a location to another without people’s control. But people still can track its location and the delivery status. In case mine abilities are limited and cannot do the autonomous robot, I have a back-up idea is building a robot that can move based on our hand gesture, voice control or mind control (it might be harder than the others), or simply, we can control the robot by using an app on our smart devices, such as phones, tablets, or laptops. Overall, the intention of my project is creating a robot to carry things around, so people do not need to touch the packages and carry heavy things. </br>
                    <br></br>
                <u>Motivation:</u></br>
            I have spent two years studying in America and I was living in the girls’ dorm. Every time I need to pack my stuff and move between rooms, it took hours for me to carry heavy things, especially textbooks, from my room to another.  When it came to move the boxes that contained my stuff, I had to asked one or two more girls to help me move those boxes to my new room, it was time-consuming just to moving things around. Another reason why I want to create an autonomous robot is to avoid the contact between people as much as possible. Unlike Vietnam, during the pandemic, the States is like a mess, the patients who have corona virus is increasing day by day, but some people are still hanging around, avoiding following the social distancing. Because of that, any stranger that come to my dorm could be a threat to spread the virus, also if anyone in the dorm had Covid-19, it would be hard to control since we were living in a big group of people. That is why I want to make a robot that can carry the stuff from the delivers to the students in the dorm to avoid people’s interactions. Of course, the robot and packages will be sanitized regularly by the dorm parents before they reach the students. </br>
        <br></br>
                    <u>Description:</u></br>
                    <br></br>
                        <b>Design:</b></br>
                           The autonomous robot will be designed into a four-wheels or six-wheel robot to keep balance and travel easily between a location to another, also, the wheel will be well-designed to move in different terrain (climbing stairs, crossing over a puddle, moving on a bumpy road). The robot will be able to carry packages which has the total weight that less than 10 kilograms. I intend to limit the weight that the robot can carry in order to minimize the size of the robot, I want to make it flexible to travel between narrow areas. The package will be stored in a hamper that has the lid on the top that automatic locked when the package is put inside and only open after the receiver confirms that he or she has met the robot. </br>
<br></br>
                     <b>Area of operation:</b></br>
                 The robot will be operated in the limited area, within 3 kilometers. Because this robot is personal use, small campus, or a dorm use so the robot does not need to travel so far. Also, moving in a defined distance helps us keep track the robot easily.  Because it is going to be used in the small area, the robot does not need a high speed, maybe 5 kilometers per hour is enough for it to travel. It will move slowly on sidewalks at a walking pace. </br>
<br></br>
                     <b>How does it work?</b></br>
                         In brief words, robot is required to avoid obstacles along the way to the receiver’s location but keep the right track to the targeted place. By using sensors to detect the surrounding environment, the robot will know if there are obstacles on its way or not. From those sensors, it will produce the information for the robot to make real-time decisions to avoid those obstacles, also update the current situation for the trackers.  There are many sensors that will be used for the robot: proximity sensor and infrared sensor to detect the presence of an obstacles and the positions of them, also proximity sensor can be used to determine the location of the robot. The robot will also use cameras, not only for trackers to observe the movements of robot, but also the cameras will act as the sensors for robot to navigate the area. </br>
<br></br>
                <b>Can people still know about the robot status?</b></br>
                         Person who sent the packages and the one who receive it can track the robot’s location and the delivery status by using the app that has set the route for robot before, also on the map, it will show the package’s status, such as  “The package is on the way” with the estimate time to the destination, “The package has arrived” with the confirmation that sent to the receiver to confirm and open the lid of the robot to get the package then it will notify “The package has been delivered” so both deliver and receiver can ensure the package has safely arrived ...etc. Also, the robot might have the camera so people can supervise the surround areas to make sure nothing happens to the robot. In case the robot is stolen or damaged by any physical action, we will know by observe the camera, or by the notification that sent by the robot. </br>
<br></br>
                         <b>Power source:</b></br>
              I want to make the eco-friendly robot so it will run with solar power by using solar panels to collect energy from the sun and convert it into electricity. If not, the robot will use batteries that store electricity which is converted from solar power. At least, if I use normal batteries for the robot, try to use as little as possible. </br>
<br></br>
                         <b>If I cannot make an autonomous robot? </b></br>
                In case mine abilities are limited and cannot do the autonomous robot, I have a back-up idea is building a robot that can move based on our hand gesture, voice control or mind control (it might be harder than the others), or simply, we can control the robot by using an app on our smart devices, such as phones, tablets, or laptops. Overall, the intention of my project is creating a robot to carry things around, so people do not need to touch the packages and carry heavy things. </br>
<br></br>
                     <u>Tools and Technologies:</u></br>
                For the hardware, I will use sensors to navigate the area around robot, Arduino, or Raspberry Pi to read the information that is gathered from the sensors. Maybe I will also add the RFID tag to track the location of the robot and send it to the users. The energy source will be solar panels to gather sunlight or normal batteries with a battery holder to provide the energy for the robot to operate. For the software, I will mainly use Arduino IDE and Raspbian OS as they are the official supported operating systems for Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards. Because the robot require integration with different sensors and physical devices, Python is also considered because it works well with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I will use Python to store data and manage them in the database, also, set some commands for the robot, beside the fact that the robot will have the ability to make real-time decisions. </br>
