                                The name for my team is going to be A.R.T (Autonomous Robots Technology) because I want to focus on creating autonomous robots, also I think building a robot just like creating an artwork, you have to use your creativity to make an innovation that has specific purpose to serve human needs. When it comes to the word “technology”, we just think of something that concrete, practical, logic-based and lack of emotions, but when we see the word “art”, we mainly expect something creative, abstract, and emotional. What if we can combine “art” and “technology” to make something which is both creative and functional. 
                            </p>
                       
                            <h3>My ideal teammates:</h3>
                            <p>
                               From the personality tests for Assignment 1, I was determined as “The Logicians” which is a group of people who always thinks about the world in abstracts way and tries to solve problems logically. We are hungry for new things and always curious about the world surrounding us. Moreover, The Logicians are straightforward, we respect the truth and put integrity as an important characteristic. Also, from The Big Five Personality Test, the “Openness” trait also describes a person's tendency to think abstractly. They enjoy playing with ideas and discovering novel experiences. <br/>
“Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.”<br/>
                        <br></br>
Compare to my own personalities and how I act every day, those results are very accurate. I am a visual learner who like to observe everything around me. I like to play puzzles, sudoku and I am passionate about programming, which requires lots of logical thinking. People always complain me as a sensitive person because I usually overthink a trouble and make it more complicated. That is why I prefer a straightforward answer, an uncertain explanation just makes me turned some simple words into complex ones. If I make any mistakes, I will apologize and explain right away because I want to get straight to the point and face my failure. Sometimes, we make mistakes and learn from it so there is nothing to be ashamed of or lie for.</br>
                        <br></br>
Because of that, the first thing I am looking from my team members is integrity. Whatever our team ability is, not because we need the higher grade, never steal works from others’ because it is a sinful action and might cause several serious problems afterwards, we just need to try our best and do as much as we can. Also, I do not want my teammates to be conceited, arrogant or self-centered. Again, I’m a straightforward person so I accept my failure and do not fear to receive feedbacks from others, so I want my teammates to have the same characteristic, no one is perfect and we make mistakes sometimes but the thing I treasure is we accept our weaknesses and know how to change it for the better, I do not like person who thinks his or her idea is the best and never listen to others, it is a selfish thinking and can kill the self-development. I want to keep my team balance so if there is four members in my team, I want to find another person who share the same characteristics with me, a person who like to solve problems, think abstractly and logically. We can help each other to coding our project and discuss about problems in the same aspect. But as a person who always focuses on looking for new ideas, sometimes I forgot to make those ideas become actions. Also, the abstract thoughts might make me turn something simple into a complex one. When it comes, I need someone conscious and concrete to keep everything as simple as it can, and to make sure everything is going to work, physically but not only a brief idea on papers. There will be two members with the personalities like that. People with the opposite characteristics might sometimes have conflicts with each other’s but it also balances the team if the listen, respect individual’s opinions and know how to work together efficiently as a team.
