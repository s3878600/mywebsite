                             My teammates and I both agree that I have given a detailed idea yet ambitious and unrealistic one. My project idea has listed quite detail functions of the autonomous robot but the way how to do create and build is missing. The reason for it is because I am lack of knowledge about create a robot, also the way to make it run autonomously. It a common sense for a freshman like me, also other teammates. Because of that, my project idea is likely a professional scientist project than a project for students. It is advanced and complicated because our team needs to work both on software and hardware. For software, we need to have deep understanding about Python, as well as Arduino IDE and Raspbian OS to perform closed-loop control system for the robot to make decisions on its own. For hardware, we need to have some knowledge about small computing devices, especially how to build Arduinos and Raspberry Pi boards. Time limit is also a difficulty for us because for a project that is complicated like that, there should be at least 2 to 3 months to complete it, it is impossible for us to complete it in 3 weeks, not to mention we also have assignments that need to be completed for other courses. Also, it might cost lots of money to buy the hardware in order to construct the robot, which is not necessary. Not for the content of the project idea, but those feedbacks make me realize that I am so ambitious and have put myself too much. To be honest, I really like to build an autonomous one day but not right now. I think those feedbacks will help me make more careful decision in the future, also have mindful evaluate about my own abilities, also team’s abilities and the conditions to complete the project, such as its difficulty, the deadline for the project, etc.,</br>

 I can see your ambition in this project. It is even outside our area of expertise and it is too expensive for simply the job of transporting stuffs however, it had a good future as it will be helpful if we can mass-produce it. I can see it working wonderfully, but for it be able to do all that, it will be very complicated, and it will be too hard for people who are still in their 1st year. Nevertheless, I can say it can have a bright future ahead if you be able to make it happen not just for school but the whole world might be using it.</br>

I think that your idea is well-interpreted. However, for the idea to work, it needs to be considered through “Moral dilemma”, which is something that scientists has fought for over the last decade. Simply put, the robot developers should be aware of the unwanted situation, like the Moral dilemma. Furthermore, the development of the robot would be costly for students like us, in order to conduct a project like your idea, funds should be raised and collected to buy necessary resources. This idea might be ideal in the long run, but not for a short period of time.</br>

<i>Nguyễn Phương Nam:</i></br>

Wow, this idea is so unrealistic for us to do. Not mention to our knowledge, autonomous robot is a complicated project for everyone even though they have experience in this field. However, I can see your ambition in this project. If we can make it done, probably our robot will be very useful for the humanity due to its multifunctional. In spite of its complexbility and the absolutely huge amount of work we have to do, I impress of your idea.</br>
<br></br>
<i>Võ Khải Minh:</i></br>

This in indeed an interrest idea with lots of potential when it comes to carrying heavy things from point A to point B, but when compare your idea to our available knowledge, we arent in the same level so in order to make this project possible, lots of effort need to put in. Althought time cusumming is also a problem, I think it is a great idea, whos know this could be your future career.
