                            <p>
                                My project is about creating an autonomous delivery robot, so the inventions I want to introduce are: the autonomy of robots and small computing devices.
                            </p>
                            <h3>About the autonomous robots:</h3>
                              <p> To highlight the state of art of the autonomous robot, we should compare between traditional robot and the autonomous one, and there are lots of things can be mentioned. Traditional robot can only operate based on human’s control, it cannot make it own decisions, instead, it only works based on the commands that have been made forehand by using coding programs. It uses just a few or no sensor so it cannot make the interaction with the surround environment. Because of that, it cannot deal with the unexpected situations and only know how to work via “teach box” – commands that the operators input so the robot can follow. Compare to traditional robot, this robot can perform better autonomy: the robot is capable of achieve task objectives without human input, it can deal with the unexpected situations by making and execute its own real-time decisions based on the information that given via the sensors. It can adapt and adjust accordingly to the surround environment without waiting for people to write the commands all over again. To sum up, the autonomous robot is capable to interact with human or response to the changes of environment. Until today, there is still no fully functioned autonomous robots, but the idea about completely autonomous robots have been brought out by many inventors. Such as The Boeing autonomous aircraft which is functioned to make a completely autonomous flight from take-off to landing with a range of up to 50 miles. For autonomous car, we can mention about the Google’s Waymo, a driverless car which operates and drives on its own. Had a chance to experience this autonomous car, Andrew J. Hawkins wrote “The steering wheel spins on its own. The pedals go up and down as if pressed by some phantom foot. The seatbelt is clicked into place but technically protects nothing. The vehicle drives more assertively than it has in previous trips, breezing past construction sites at 45 mph with barely a twitch and nudging its way into intersections in a way that feels less robotic than it has in the past”. There are 5 levels of autonomous driving and this Waymo car has reached level 4 – the high automation. At this level, “vehicles are capable of steering, accelerating, and braking on their own. They're also able to monitor road conditions and respond to obstacles, determining when to turn and when to change lanes. Level 4 autonomous driving can only be activated when road conditions are ideal.”. So, at the level 5, we can expect a vehicle that can operate on their own, respond to avoid the objects on its way, and change lanes, and all of this can be done even the road condition is not ideal: flood, car accident happened ahead, traffic jam, etc. To make it possible, we are looking forward to the development of the sensor control. Because for a robot to accurately achieve a task in an intelligent environment, a robot has to be able to react dynamically to changes in its surrounding.</br>
                        <br></br>
The autonomy for robots is just like an evolution for the robot. Now the robot can do more works without relying on human’s instructions. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, with a high accuracy and safety, also the tasks can be done more quickly.  It can work in hazardous places, such as sewers or nuclear plants so workers do not need to risk their life working in those dangerous environments. When it comes to over-loaded working place such as the hospitals, those autonomous robots replace some of the staff’s tasks such as deliver lab results and patient sample, collecting data from the patient, track and detect current situation of the patient and notify to the doctors, nurses, for example, it will let the doctors know if the patient’s heart beats suddenly drop or raise, or whenever the patient has a stroke, etc. The autonomous vehicles might help the disable people to travel easier, sometimes those people cannot handle with some tasks to drive vehicles or they cannot response as quickly as normal people, when it comes to those situations, the autonomous vehicles can support them to drive. But everything has its drawbacks, although those autonomous robots can help people done dangerous tasks and reduce the time to complete works, because of those functions, current employees can be replaced by those robots. First is the time efficiency, a robot can perform tasks very fast, in the same amount of time, a single robot can complete much more works than a single person, also, a robot can operate in a long period of time, so it takes less time to complete a task but still keep the high accuracy. The companies can reduce the fund that is used for hiring and paying salary of the employees, those firms only need to spend money on buying those autonomous robots and maintaining them.  Second thing, the autonomous robots can work in the hazardous environment, the companies will spend less on industrial life insurance, also do not need to worry much about the casualties that might happen while performing dangerous tasks. Because those benefits, people might not be able to compete with autonomous robots in the workforce.</br>
                <br></br>
In my daily life, the autonomous robots might help me a lot. Just like my idea about autonomous delivery robot, if it can come true, it will save tons of time to move my belongings around. Also, it will avoid the risks, such as hurting my back, or the stuff might fall and hurt my feet when I have to carry heavy or fragile objects. Also reduce the chance that those stuff will accidently drop and be damaged. Another example in my daily life that I can tell is the autonomous vacuum robot. It is so popular that more and more households start using it and introduce this robot to their friends. Just like my mother, she finds it very useful and convenient to use the self-vacuum robot. She is not a person who know much about technology, but she said that it is very easy to use it, she just needs to press the Start button, set up the cleaning mode then let the robot roam around the room and do its job. According to her, the robot is vacuum as clean as when she does it by herself, even cleaner at some points. Because the size of robot is small, it can reach the areas that out of human hands, such as under the bed, under the closet or narrow spaces that we cannot clean. If she wants to make sure, she just needs to sweep the floor twice or three times a week. She very satisfied with the robot because it saves her time, makes her do less work and she does not need to hire the maid anymore. Although the robot helps my mother saved her money, it accidently makes my old maid lose her job, makes her become unemployed. Everything has two sides of it, the autonomous can assist some people to complete their job while taking the job opportunities from other workers.

                                <u>What is Arduino?</u></br>
                               According to its website, it wrote that:<br/>
“Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.”<br/>
                        <br></br>
                    <u>How about Raspberry Pi?</u><br/>
From its website: <br/>
“The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.
What’s more, the Raspberry Pi  has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work.”<br/>
                    <br></br>
To sum up, although we call Arduino and Raspberry as small computing devices. They are quite different from each other. Arduino is a small controller, it is able to read the input data, for example the information that gathered from the sensors then perform an action, such as turn on/off the lights, make a robot to move, etc. Because it is just a controller, Arduino cannot run a full operating system. Meanwhile, Raspberry Pi is a fully functioned minicomputer which can be used to connecting to the internet, coding a program, displaying images, videos, and other things that an ordinary computer can do. Those are very useful for the beginners who want to learn about building hardware stuff, because they are not very expensive, easy to get used to, have tons of functions so we can apply them of many different projects. Because of that, Raspberry pi and Arduino are also used for educated purposes, they encourage children to learn about coding as well as creating new inventions with hardware. For me, it impacts me a lot and also my fellows, at first, the idea about autonomous came to my mind but I have no idea how we can build it from scratch. Also, from my knowledge, the number 4 in front of the Schools of Science and Technology is the project that was built from Arduino, image how year 1 students could build a stunning project like that. Arduino had made their project idea come to life.<br/>
